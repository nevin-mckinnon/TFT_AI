A single-file standalone HTML app to help find Teamfight Tactics (TFT) optimal team comps using Graph Neural Network (GNN) for set 15

# Key Features
**Exhaustive Search:** Guarantees finding every possible team that meets your exact criteria (when GNN pruning is off).

**GNN-Assisted Pruning:** Uses a GNN to vastly speed up the search by pruning unpromising possibilities. Pruning strength is fully adjustable.

**Deep Customization:** Filter by team size, included/excluded champions, required trait levels, trait emblems, and exact unit counts by cost.

**Live Results:** You can see the best compositions appear and update in real time as the algorithm runs.

**Zero Dependencies:** The entire application runs from a single .html file with no installation required.
